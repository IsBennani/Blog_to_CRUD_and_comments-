# README

A blog where i tried to CRUD. 

then I added some comments sections .. 

( and spent 2 hours, to realise that without  has_many on the article class  no comments would be seen)
( thanks to stack overflow, meditation, and tech lead. he is cool, so i am)

( PS Never arg with negativity, anyway anyhow, just delete it. just delete it. you own your path, just do it)

then i ll make some authentication sauce. to taste tasty.
