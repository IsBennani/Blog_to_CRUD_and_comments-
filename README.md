# README

A blog where i tried to CRUD. 

then I added some comments sections .. 

( and spent 2 hours, to realise that has_many on the article would help)
( thanks to stack overflow, meditation, and tech lead. he is cool, so i am)

then may be i ll commit how to delete a comment, to keep only positivity in my world. 
( PS Never arg with negativity, anyway anyhow, just delete it. over you a blue sky. )

then i ll make some authentication sauce. to taste tasty.
